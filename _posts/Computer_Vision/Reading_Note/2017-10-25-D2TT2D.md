## CONTRIBUTION ##

1. A ConvNet architecture is set up for simultaneous detection and tracking, using a multi-task objective for frame-based object detection and across-frame track regression.
2. Correlation features that represent object co-occurrences across time are introduced to aid the ConvNet during tracking.
3. Frame-level detections are linked to produce high accuracy detections at the video-level based on across-frame tracklets .

## METHOD ##

For frame-level detections, this work adopts [R-FCN](https://joshua19881228.github.io/2016-05-23-RFCN/) as the base framework to detect objects in a single frame. The inter-frame correlation features are extracted from the feature maps of the two frames. A multi-task loss of localization, classification and displacement is used to train the net work. The workflow of this work is shown in the following figure.

The key innovation of this work is an operation denoted as **ROI tracking**. The input of this operation is the bounding box regression features of the two frames $\textbf{x}_{reg}^{t}$, $\textbf{x}_{reg}^{t+\tau}$ and the correlation features $\textbf{x}^{t,t+\tau}_{corr}$, which are concatenated. The correlation layer performs point-wise feature comparison of two feature maps $\textbf{x}^{t}_{l}$, $\textbf{x}^{t+\tau}_{l}$

$$ \textbf{x}_{corr}^{t,t+\tau} (i,j,p,q) = \langle \textbf{x}_{l}^{t} (i,j), \textbf{x}_{l}^{t+\tau} (i+p,j+q) \rangle $$

where $-d \leq p \leq d$ and $-d \leq q \leq d$ are offsets to compare features in a square neighbourhood around the locations $i$, $j$ in the feature map, defined by the maximum displacement $d$. 

The loss function is written as

$$ Loss(\{p_i\},\{b_i\},\{\Delta_i\} ) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}L_{cls}(p_i,c^{*}) + \lambda \frac{1}{N_{fg}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [c_i^*>0] L_{reg}(b_i, b_i^*) + \lambda \frac{1}{N_{tra}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{tra}} L_{tra}(\Delta_i^{t+\tau}, \Delta_i^{*,t+\tau}) $$
